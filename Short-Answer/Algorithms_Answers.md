#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
    <!-- Constant O(1), this can only ever run once.... -->
    Linear O(n), disregarding the specifics of the code, the existence of that while loop suggests O(n) 

b)
    Quadratic O(n^2), each iteration of the while loop for j is an interation inside an iteration of the for loop for n.

c)
    Linear O(n), its going to run once for every n (num of bunnies).

## Exercise II
Binary search algo O(log n)

Find the middle floor of the building, drop an egg out the window.
If egg breaks, find the middle floor between your current floor and the bottom, drop an egg out the window... etc
If the egg didnt break, do the same thing but going up the building until it does break. continue this process until the find f aka 'Humpty Dumpty's constant' (probably).
